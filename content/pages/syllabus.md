Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Overview
--------

We cover human experimental cognitive psychology, the study of human intelligent processing. Includes high-level vision (e.g., object recognition), attention, immediate and longer-term memory, learning, nature of concepts, imagery, language processing, mental codes, reasoning, and problem-solving. Emphasis on experimental methods and evidence.

IT IS ESSENTIAL TO COME TO LABS AND THE QUIZZES. Note the dates on which the lab reports are due. There will be handouts with an outline at the beginning of most lectures, but they will not provide all the information you need; there will be space on the handout to add your own notes during the lecture.
